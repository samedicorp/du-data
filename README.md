# du-data

An open source repository containing data files useful for [Dual Universe](https://dualthegame.com) scripting.

### Industry

The first file in this repo is a dump of all schematics JSON data.

There is a lot of repetition in this file. I plan to also add an automatic script which processes this file each time it is committed, and produces some indexes along with a more compact form.
